# ashrae-great-energy-predictor-3-overview-analysis

This repository is for overview analysis of ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor Shootout III in 2019.

Analysis Phases:

Phase 1 - In this phase, we will prepare to create slides to be submitted for the ASHRAE Winter Meeting in Orlando - this will include overall statistics and some understanding of the models used in the process.

Phase 2 - Here will will aggregate results, create visualisations, and write up drafts for several journal publications.

## Objectives in this phase (Phase 2):
Finish and submit Jounal Paper: <The ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III Kaggle Competition: Overview and Discussion of Results>
Check and complete corresponding assignments on working document before deadline:

#### Some requests:
* Please use the google doc as a working document by continuously updating it with comment and content. Don't write something up elsewhere to be added
* Most of the images are Google Drawings that I’ve dropped example graphics into — you can edit these by double clicking on them to add the new content (instead of using power point to make the combined graphics)
* If you have references that you would like to add to the manuscript, you can leave a comment with the name of the reference and link and the text highlighted where the reference should be placed. I will find the reference and insert it into the manuscript with Paperpile.
