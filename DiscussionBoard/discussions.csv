Part 1
Random thoughts about competition.
This competition is about predicting energy consumption.
When I look at data I see ""not very reach"" features dataset. Seems that we can and have to use a lot of external data.
Weather - very important (here are some kernels about weather time-series data):

https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package
https://www.kaggle.com/c/recruit-restaurant-visitor-forecasting (please see discussions and winning solutions)
We don't predict the weather here. But if we do have? What if energy consumption has a strong connection with ""people's feelings"" about the weather tomorrow.

Geo markers (probably we can supplement data with this information).
Wealth (also with categorical subsets).
Building condition (supplement with some thermal physics data).
etc.
It seems to me now that data that we have just a skeleton and we can and have to find interesting correlated data on external resources. 
My advice here constantly monitor this thread:

etc


Minification.
One of the first steps that should be done is data minification (just my opinion).
You will need it for:

Load data faster -> pickle format (best choice for me)
Consume less memory -> Carefull types downcasting
Avoid repeated cleaning steps.

Possible problems:

pandas pickle format is ""version dependent"" and you may have problems with loading data generated with a newer version of Pandas
Any bad transformation may and will affect your model. Minification should be done very veeeeery careful as you will use it in every single your kernel in the future. If you not sure about downcasting some column -> don't do. If not sure about cleaning -> don't do. All wrong decisions here may and will affect your score. You may spend days searching for error that prevents your model converge well and find that it was you who created an error in the minification step.

DON'T copy that kernels blindly. Try to understand the code and write your own that serves you. You may use that links just for reference.


Baseline
https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ashrae-data-minification
The baseline model is a model without any FE and without any model tuning. It will give you an idea of the very base/ground score that you can have with untransformed data. Conducting experiments you have to compare scores with some stable result.  
Let's think about what ways we have to improve a single model score:

FE obviously
CV
Model tuning 
Evaluation metric 
Loss function

CV
Think about how you can make it reliable and align your CV with LB.
Without good CV all modifications are ""blind shoots"" and can't be analyzed and evaluated.
Model tuning
It's up to you to decide when you want to do tuning, but my advice is to do at least some minimal tuning in the beginning. Normally (in most cases) model performance depends on the data structure and if it will be untouched your initial params can serve you almost until the end of the competition. In the beginning, it is easier to do as you have just a minimal number of features and any GridSearch/Bayesian optimization will run faster. 
Evaluation metric/Loss function
In my case, I've used RMSE but the competition metric is RMSLE. If you will use lgbm please consult these examples for custom metric and custom loss function:

https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/examples/python-guide/advanced_example.py
https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/examples/python-guide/sklearn_example.py

https://www.kaggle.com/yukari17/simple-prediction-do-not-use-model-v2 (by @yukari17 / without any Model)


Never copy others solutions, use it as a reference and create your own baseline with model you know better. For sure it will take much more time but you will benefit much more from own code. Others approaches could have mistakes, errors, incorrect code.

Before reading other's EDAs kernels try to make your own. If you are as lazy as I am - go to read part.
EDA is one of the most important parts of any competition. This your source for FE/CV/Model. Understanding the data and its structure is a crucial step to move on.

CV
https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ashrae-cv-options
We have several problems here (you may want to check the linked kernel).

Consumption can't be well generalized (with data we have). For unknown siteid and buildingid our predictions are terrible. The same happens with monthly consumption. It means that we should train the final model on all months and all buildings to get the most accurate predictions. You can think of it that consumption is very specific for each building, each zone, and date. Also, it's mean that we don't have all necessary data.
The previous point shows us the importance of siteid and buildingid which seems to me should be enriched by external data.
Not possible to safely use early stoppings. 
Features validation is becoming very tricky and not very accurate.
In my opinion, the best FE validation option is 4/4/4 train/skip/validate - if there is a proved RMSLE boost for the feature it is safe to use it for test predictions.
Boosting rounds for the final model should be more than for FE validation but not much.


FE
What works:

Target/mean encoding
Outliers imputation
Categorisation 

Adversarial validation shows that test set doesn't differ much from train set:

https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/adversarial-ashrae (it's IMPORTANT)

We don't have many features so for features selection you can safely use (if you have stable CV):

recursive feature elimination (remove 1 by 1)
permutation importance
recursive feature acceptance (add 1 by 1)


Blend/Stacking
Blend works - you can have at least 1-2% of RMSLE with different model blending.
Stacking is very tricky as it will overfit hugely for test set. As I see it's almost impossible to use it here. But you may find a way to implement it in your pipeline.

Just a short note to introduce you to the ASHRAE ""Contest Administration"" Team, led by myself. As the current chair of ASHRAE Technical Committee 4.7 (Energy Calculations), it gives me great pleasure to see this contest launch - the next step in supporting ASHRAE's mission - ""To serve humanity by advancing the arts and sciences of heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration and their allied fields.""
Our team is supported two of my good colleagues and friends - Dr. Jeff Haberl and  Krishnan Gowri. 
We represent a small, diverse and dedicated group of volunteers who have been working together over the past 16 months to create the relationships and pull together the necessary resources to launch a successful Kaggle data competition.  
Our shared goals are to uncover (and disseminate to the public) current ""best practices"" for methods of time series predictions that can be useful in our domain.  During the contest, the 'Administration Team"" will be monitoring the discussion board to respond to your queries, as appropriate.  Contest winners and participants should expect more interaction with the Administration Team as we work together to find creative ways to disseminate the results to our community at large. 
Good Luck!

Yes, everybody is spending their time finding new leaks. If that's your thing, feel free to be bummed out or excited. But I'm finding that I can quietly work on all the other aspects of the data and make forward progress, on the assumptions that the leaks will all wash out on the private LB.
So here's what I find interesting:
Lots of different data segments:
The data has distinct behaviors in a bunch of different dimensions:

Each type of meter works differently, even within the same building. It's unclear whether there's commonality between types which can be exploited.
Each site has shared weather, and potentially shared administrative policy and reporting methods within a site. It should be possible to exploit this commonality.
Each building is its own microcosm, with many factors not reflected in the data -- insulation, equipment use, work habits, etc. Our final model must be able to account for these per-building hidden variables.

All of these distinct segments (along with time-series issues) must be considered when creating a representative CV split. I strongly that entire sites should be grouped together and split timewise. However, any further grouping may or may not be useful.
They also allow for the possibility of training completely different per-segment models, but it's unclear where it will lead to a gain in predictive power through specialization or a loss due missed commonalities. My personal belief is that per-meter-type models are a good idea, but that per-building models probably throw away too much cross-over information. I'm shying away from per-site models because I fear they'll exaggerate noise without benefitting enough from commonalities -- but I could well be wrong.
Big data:
The data can, with compression, fit within a typical Kaggler's computer memory, but there's enough of it that computation time becomes a major factor. This encourages us to use subsampling to perform faster experiments but forces us to constantly re-evaluate whether such methodologies are sound. 
I haven't seen much discussion around hyperparameter optimization for this competition, and the data size is probably the reason. With a single training run on the full data taking minutes, grid searches for hyperparameter optimization are impractical, and we need to get creative. Again, we can subsample but need to be able to argue that the hyperparameters are independent of sample size -- which is probably a bad bet. The net result is that we must either neglect hyperparameters in search of easier game or be prepared to spend a lot of time or cleverness in the search.
Finally, the fact that the size prompted a two-submissions-per-day limit means that there's probably a lot less leaderboard probing going on, and a lot more actual dependence on well-founded CVs. I know that's been the case for me at least, and I've found it somewhat refreshing.
Time-series data:
Time-series problems are often popular because they allow us to exploit sequential patterns for missing-value imputation, use lag features to track trends, and exploit domain knowledge of time-of-day, seasonal, holiday, and time-zone issues.
In this particular competition, we have the interesting (yet frustrating) fact that our training data consists of exactly one year. This makes it hard to judge common varieties of year-over-year patterns while still giving us at least one sample of each season and holiday. Is it possible, for example, to predict the effect of the 4th of July holiday based on many buildings but only one global occurrence? Does it matter that the 4th occurs on a Monday in 2016, but a Wednesday in 2018? Probably, but I don't know how much.
Since it's an international competition, we also have different holidays, different time zones, different implementations of daylight savings time, etc. This is complicated by the fact that weather is tracked in GMT, readings are tracked in local standard time, and actual building usage will be affected by local daylight savings time. How should we best account for this, or can we safely ignore it?
Dirty data:
It was clear from the start that data cleanup would make a huge difference in this competition, with the glaring set of zero-readings from site 0 begging to be fixed. Likewise, it very quickly became clear that building 1099 had such absurd outliers that they would warp our predictions for other buildings.
Whether we like it or not, these dirty data are a feature, not a bug. We were warned about it in the competition description, and post-facto write-ups of the previous ASHRAE competitions called out anomalous data handling as an important part of the process.
The challenge here is to infer whether any given set of ""outliers"" will be reflected in the test data, or if they are a phenomenon that only applies in the training data. There are many buildings/meters in this competition in which the first 5 months (or so) of data are qualitatively different from the last 7. I have a personal theory that May 15th was a deadline from the organizers for ""get your reading methodology in order"", and that any anomalous reading from before this date should be distrusted. However, ignoring the entire set would be ""throwing the baby out with the bathwater"", so we need to figure out how to ""separate the wheat from the chaff"". (Hey, look! I've used my entire daily quota of stale cliches in one sentence. Oh well.)
Zero-value meter readings are especially interesting. Some are clearly completely legitimate and predictable -- some utilities are clearly turned off for months at a time. Others are almost definitely illegitimate. In my opinion, this includes all zero-readings for electricity -- complete power-outages are rare and can (IMHO) be dropped as non-informative outliers. Long runs of consecutive zeros for a single meter (or within a single site) can indicate meter failures that should be disregarded (as is the case for the first 141 days of site 0 data). Finally, we have the class of ""pulse meters"", which will alternate between large readings and zero-readings, seemingly at random. If it's truly random, then we have little recourse, but I can't neglect the possibility that there is an actual pattern which can be exploited.
External data hunts:
The actual target leaks are annoying. Most people seem to agree on this. However, the process of hunting down and identifying the actual sites and buildings within the sites has been fascinating to watch. Given the external-data rules and Kaggler's love of sharing, this has felt like a pleasant bonus and not an annoying leak. I'm not a data-scraping guy myself, but I can enjoy watching the scrapers at work.

It was possible to reach 1.05 in this competition with only outlier removal. However most of the teams did it only for site 0.
Traditional outlier detection is 1 dimensional, but outliers in this data are dependent to several external factors such as seasonality, meter type, outliers' date frequency within site, outliers' length frequency within site and etc. That's why it had to be done for every building separately even though it was very inefficient. I tried to make it a little bit more efficient with this detection function. It is the modified version of @marshi  code here.
This function basically returns the indices of constant series of the given building and meter type if the length of series are greater than min_length.  min_length parameter had to be tuned for every building differently since the length of series were always different. I did it for every building in this kernel.

What to drop?

Electricity meter readings on another high or low level at the start of 2016. This was the only edge case this function was not used. I had to do it manually. Most of the public kernels only dropped zeros at the start of 2016, but that approach didn't cover buildings like this.

Meter readings on another high or low level due to API errors. I thought those were API errors because they exist on multiple buildings in the same sites at the same dates.  That was the time when I started considering outlier's date frequency within site for detection.

Meter readings on mean level at random dates. Removing them gave the least improvement compared to other outliers, but it still helped.

Chilled Water, Steam and Hot Water meter readings that doesn't fit their seasons. Outliers at those dates are greater than outliers at other dates.


What not to drop?

Constant meter readings at the end of 2016. I didn't drop them because some of the test set have those values.

Constant Chilled Water, Steam and Hot Water meter readings happening due to seasonality. If the model couldn't learn the effect of seasons, the result was disastrous.


Outliers that are too common. Dropping them hurts the model


After doing this operation for every buildings' every meter type. I dropped 789682 data points and break 1.04 with LightGBM in this kernel. Kaggle still evaluates the previous submissions of the kernel so it is showing old score right now.

Training data

20 Mio. samples, no missing values, no duplicates
One year worth of data, all timestamps from 2016
Timewise the measurements are quite evenly distributed.
Target variable highly skewed
Most readings measure electricity.
Generating steam consumes most energy.
Energy consumption peaks significantly in Spring, steam energy extremely so (but only due to two outliers, see below).
Chilled water most consumed in late summer.
Education buildings consume by far most of energy, then come office buildings. 
Buildings between 300-400k square feet by far with highest consumption (again due to the two outliers, see below)
Buildings have up to four types of meters, most have one (or three) types.
Distinct ranges of meter readings per building observable.
3750 outliers for meter_reading. They stem from just 2 buildings (1099, 778) and come from steam and chilledwater. 
Building 1099 consumes lots of steam energy.
Buildings 1099 and 778 are massive outliers. Examining the data with and without these two buildings yields very different results. 
Possible meter failures eg building 218, 192. See this thread..
Buildings on site_id == 0 have either zero or small readings in the first 5 months of 2016. Thread.


Test data

Private dataset seems to be the last 22% of the data, time ordered (test set and row_id column are not strictly time ordered). Thread here.


Building data

1449 unique buildings on 16 sites built between 1900 and 2017 
7 buildings (building_id = 28, 45, 46, 99, 103, 409, 567) built in timespan of training data 2016. 
Building 363 built in 2017, but consumes energy in 2016. More here.
Wide variety of size and height: 283 to 875k sqft, 1 to 26 floors
16 types of usage
14 sites with mixed types of buildings, 2 with just one type
site_id likely a city or area rather than a specific compound of buildings
Distribution of square_feet highly skewed
Parking facilities much bigger on average than all other types
Food, parking, retail among the most recent built buildings
Technology and science related buildings on average the oldest
Lodging/residential on average the highest buildings
29 outliers for square_feet and 5 for floor_count


Weather data

417016 samples, several duplicates, lots of missing values
All buildings from northern hemisphere, since seasonal temperature in general follows the same pattern
cloudcoverage for siteid 12 is much higher than on all other sites.
sea_level_pressure for site_id 5 is entirely missing (NaN).
Sites 1, 5, 12 likely in Europe due to timezone and use of Celsius, sites 7 and 11 in Canada due to the timezone, use of C and July 1st, others potentially in US due to the timezone and use of F. Thread here.
Weather data likely not in local time. Thread.
Wind direction has implicit duplicates with values 0 and 360. Can easily be deduplicated. Wind direction as modelling features as such likely negligible though.


Correlations

Correlations of all features (buildings and weather included) differ substantially between sites
Only weak correlations to meter_reading

I've always thought this should be a Kaggle motto.
When I registered on the site, I could not even imagine how much Kaggle would mean to me. The goal was simple - to check my knowledge, take part in a couple of competitions. Place a checkmark for the completed stage and move on.
Did I think then that I could win a medal, of course not? And of course, I could not imagine that I could win a competition. But all this is possible. How?
Join, Learn, Share.

Year-long path
My first competition:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales

The first test. I thought that I would spend a week, maybe two, and finish, but when you see how you climb in the leaderboard, you see how “new cool things” make your model better and you can’t stop. You try harder and harder. How is it that the guy in the first place scores better than yours? If he succeeded, then it is possible, then you need to learn, read, try harder.
And here you are in the first place. So far, only in the sandbox, where such mastodons as Giba do not shred the whole leaderboard top and you gain faith in your own strengths.
In parallel with the competition, I went into reading the forum - I have not seen so much information, the necessary information for a long time or never at all.
The whole month the schedule was: work, 2 hours of coding, 2 hours of reading, plan for tomorrow. And it gave a result.
Tip: set a schedule for yourself, read a lot, try to “code” what you learned. Regularity and practice. Set up a time window for Kaggle when nothing distracts you.

The second competition:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/elo-merchant-category-recommendation

After the sandbox, my appetite flashed and I wanted to try a real competition. I did not believe in a good result, but I really wanted to try - the final result is a “ghost” silver medal - cut from the leaderboard for using the second account. Yes, I was young and stupid. It's not stupid to use a second account to analyze your work more quickly but I'm blaming myself for showing such disrespect to thousands of participants (I knew that I would be removed from the leaderboard, I just wanted to check my strength). Now I am very ashamed of that period.
Tip: do not use a second account)) this is something you will regret for a very long time.

Third competition:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction

No second accounts. 2 hours to code, 2 hours to read. Read about everything: models, validation, imbalance data, python, statistics. If you don’t know something, this is not a reason to quit; it is a reason to learn something new.
It was a time when I met very talented Data Scientists, those whom I can call friends now.
The final result, which I am very proud of 48th place in the largest Kaggle competition. It was a huge achievement for me and gave confidence in my abilities.

**TLDR: **
My guess is that sites 1, 5, 12 are in Europe due to the timezone and use of Celsius
Sites 7 and 11 are in Canada due to the timezone, use of C and July 1st
Others are potentially in the US due to the timezone and use of F

When I plotted a histogram of Air Temperatures (using size 1 bins), I was surprised to see that bins 9,14,19,24,29,34 had fewer records than expected.
Looking deeper into it, it seems that this is because some of the temperature values have been converted from F to C. 
For example:
56F = 13.3C
57F = 13.9C
58F = 14.4C
59F = 15C
60F = 15.6C
From the examples above, I hope you can see why the 14 bin has fewer records than the 13 or 15 bins.
So, for a lot of the temperature data,we have 0.5 or 0.6 jumps depending on rounding.

That's not all.
If you look at temperature data site ID by site ID, the jumps from one value to the next can be classified into the following:
1) ~0.6 jumps  (converted from F?)
siteID's: 3, 4, 6, 10, 14
2) ~0.6 jumps  (with some rare extra values, often integers):
0, 2, 6, 8, 13, 15
3) 1.0 jumps (only integer C values)
5
4) 0.1 jumps
1, 7, 11, 12
So I guess you could separate those into two groups: Celsius vs Fahrenheit. This could give us a hint on geographical location.

Next, we can look at what time of the day peak temperature occurs.
As others have noted, temperature sometimes peaks in the evening, which implies that the time for temperature date is not local.
I noticed 3 different types values for the hour of day with highest average temperature:
19:00-20:00-21:00: siteIDs 0, 3, 6 , 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15
14:00:  1,  5, 12
22:00-23:00: 2, 4, 10
My guess is that the timestamp is UTC or something close by.  
Note that siteIDs 1, 5, 12 are both in celcius and with a 14:00 high temperature.
Difference between 19:00 and 22:00 could come from US time zones. 
Potentially the other 2 siteIDS with Celsius data (7, 11) are in the same timezones as USA but different countries.

Site id 7 and 11 are in Celsius, and appears to have a 3 day weekend with lower power usage that includes Friday, July 1st => Canada day! (Only educational buildings there btw)

It was the first serious competition for me, I spent a lot of hours and learn a lot from Kaggle discussion/notebooks (thanks to all authors) and internet search, but it seems that now competition is more trying to search relevant info than about creating models for accurate predictions.
But anyway it was very interesting and useful :)
I've decided to share with my current findings and thoughts:

I think I've found two new locations for sites:

site_id=4 is probably UC Berkeley - https://www.ucop.edu/facilities-management-services/_files/deep-efficiency-and-cogen.pdf
I found matches with table 6.5
site_id=10 is probably Weber State University  - https://apps.weber.edu/wsuimages/sustainability/Plans%20and%20Reports/ESIP%20II%20Manual%20wAppendices%202-1-2015.pdf
I found multiple matches there, as I remember in tables and probably also in text
If we plot test data by site_id in the order of row_id, you can find 3 separates increasing stepwise lines, it seems that some data was added later to main block. Number of records for 2 last blocks (grouped by site_id, building_id) are suspiciously equal in multiple cases. 
I thought that maybe there are nans/zeros, but public LB doesn't confirm it for me. 
Using CatBoost and Parameter tuning in documentation (https://catboost.ai/docs/concepts/parameter-tuning.html), model training can be increased in 3-4x times with increasing (in my case) accuracy. So one model with ~15 parameters and ~22 minutes of training can give 1.09 LB score.
I was surprised that although site_id and building_id is used in almost every public model, for me not using these 2 features in model gives me better results
One of the features that I used is “feels like” feature, using meteocalc package and formula for relative humidity based on air and dew temperatures. So feature calculation includes 2 temperatures and wind speed, and gives me more feature importance than these features separately
Besides trimming data leading zeros for site_id=0 as was discussed earlier, I tried to use some empirical method to truncate leading zeros with probable outliers - for example, cut leading data while cumulative mean of meter_reading is less than specific threshold. This method is not precise of course, but it can automatically truncate almost the same data for site_id=0 and also for other sites, and it helps me to descrease rmse locally and on LB.
There are a lot of repositories in github.com/buds-lab organization that can be useful (not only 
that were mentioned already):

the-building-data-genome-project
building-prediction-benchmarking
island-of-misfit-buildings
energystar-plus-plus
temporal-features-for-nonres-buildings-library
enerNOC-100-building-open-dataset-analysis
forensic-analysis-of-building-energy-data  

You can find there information about preprocessing, tz conversion, modeling etc for building energy data

I found the files that can be another potential data leak: 
https://github.com/buds-lab/island-of-misfit-buildings/blob/master/data/raw/DGS_322_Buildings-15m-By_Building-DST-gap-filled-3-2-18-508pm.csv
It contains data of 15-min meters reading with buildings which name is very similar to site_id=3 (DC) till December 2018  
In this folder:
https://github.com/buds-lab/island-of-misfit-buildings/tree/master/data/processed 
there is a processed version of this data (resampled by 1 hour), this data is noisy with gaps but it seems that information is correlated with train data for site_id=3  
Also this data contains temperature in F, so hypothesis about unit conversions to C is probably confirmed.
Detailed information about buildings you can find here:  
https://github.com/buds-lab/island-of-misfit-buildings/blob/master/data/raw/dgs_metadata.csv
Finally, I want to share with 2 articles what I recently read and like very much about time series / signal processing:
http://ataspinar.com/2018/04/04/machine-learning-with-signal-processing-techniques/
http://ataspinar.com/2018/12/21/a-guide-for-using-the-wavelet-transform-in-machine-learning/

P.S. As final submissions I choose 2 best solutions without any leaked data, so my final result will be honest and will not hurt another participants.
Thanks guys!
UPD: 
I found my notes for this competition and remember that while searching information about sites, also found probably another data leak for site_id = 13 (Twin Cities):
https://facilities.umn.edu/energy-management/building-energy-dashboards 
So for example if you search for Coffman Memorial Union which was mentioned and identified by Poe Dator  as building_id=1099 with very large values of steam consumption (https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/discussion/114830#latest-666076) and click to the link for this building, you will find some information about energy consumption.  
For example, using link ""Daily Trend Chart"" (http://meters.energy.umn.edu/enweb/HS/064_coffman/daily_trend/dte_today.html)
you can find current electricity/steam consumption, and for steam you will see that there are anomaly values also in the plot, so this is probably not error at all or maybe systematic error.
I didn't search anymore on this site, so maybe another useful information can be found there.",Data Leak

Just removing cheaters from the LB clearly doesn't seem to be a strong deterrent anymore (given the increase).

I summarize my solution.
I appreciate ASHRAE and Kaggle for this really interesting competition. In spite of some terrible leakage, this competition is not destroyed thanks to sincere kagglers and rational rules clarification by organizers.
[Feature Engineering and Feature Selection]
-Final model used only 18 features.
-I tried a lot of features but many were not useful.
-Though dew temperature has high feature importance, I removed dew temperature because CV was better without it. I think air temperature is more important and dew temperature harms the contribution of air temperature.
-Categorical Multiplication had a slight positive impact. For example siteidand_meter.
[Validation Strategy]
-Mainly based on [1-6] train [7-12] valid. [1-6] means January to June.
-Also watched [7-12] train [1-6] valid, and [1-9] train [10-12] valid.
-After leakage, I also validated by site0,1,2,15.
[Outlier Removal]
-The most important part.
-I plotted and watched all time-series carefully, and extracted so many rules that may detect outlier. I evaluated over 100 rules by the above Validation Strategy one by one.
-Examples of effective rules: “Meter 0 and long 0 segment”/”Meter 2 and start before April and long 0 segment”/”0 segments in many building at the same time”/”day average is too small in January comparing with December”.
[Single Model]
-Only LGBM.
-I tried CatBoost/time-series based methods but not worked.
-Tuned Parameters: numleaves=127, featurefraction=0.6.
[Ensemble]
-Totally 32 LGBM models.
-4 random seed averages for each model.
-[1-6] train model and [7-12] train model, similar to half-and-half kernel.
-Optimized weights for each model (Important).
--Basically, weight for [7-12] model was set higher than weight for [1-6], since [7-12] model was created from recent data.
--Furthermore, weight for [7-12] model was set higher for test data from July to December.
--Weight for [1-6] model was set higher for test data whose time-series has few train data (due to outliers) in [7-12].
[PostProcess]
-Plotted all time-series before submission and extracted some effective postprocess rules that may improve LB score.
--Modified to smaller value by applying piecewise linear function f. For example, 9.8 before log1p is modified to f(9.8)≒9.7. I searched optimal f and LB improved around 0.002. I think it is effective because there is some “unpredictable 0” but there is few “unpredictable large value“ (Important).
--Clipped to [0.1, 10.5] before log1p.
[Leak]
-Replaced leaked label just before submission (site0,1,2,15 and part of site4)
-Used for validation (site0,1,2,15)
-No other external data, no leaked data in training data, no other methods to exploit leakage.

Since it's a timeseries problem,so you would be better to split train and validation set by timestamp , sometimes kfold is also can be used for timeseries problem but it's better to  check first,you can split train and validation set by timestamp, then train a kfold-model using train set to watch the validation set performance.
Don't use features only exsited in train but not in test,for example year, time-lagged targetencoding…also don't use features that very different between train and public/private test,like a feature has no/less null values in train but lots of null values  in test, or public test has no/less null but private test has a lot.
Since the test time period is longer than train,it's hard to setup a robust validation time period,you will find parameters especially earlystop will have a big impact to leaderboard score,because it will overfit to local validation set but very different from test set. I suggested to try to adjust these parameters max_bin, num_leaves, bagging_fraction, feature_fraction, lambda_l1, lambda_l2, max_depth to deal with overfitting,and try to setup different timesplit validation to watch the change of earlystop round,At last can use a optimized round number to stop the training.
Don't trust public leaderboard too much ,because public and private are also splited by time.You can split your train data to simulate train/valid/public/private, make sure your model can improve all of them.

I hypothesize that:
Site 12 = Dublin
Site 1 = London
Site 5 =  Loughborough
Also, buildings in site 12 seem to turn things off 1 day a month (maintenance?)

In a previous post I detailed my theory that siteIDs 1, 5, 12 were in Europe, mainly due to their hypothesized timezone, but also because the temperatures seemed to have been collected directly in Celsius (rather than converted from F).
Another confirmation came from observing low usage on dates that are UK holidays that I reported in site 1.  I will provide more info about holidays in this post.

If we graph the daily average temperatures for sites1, 5, 12, they are a bit similar, but with:
** T(siteID 1)> T(siteID 5) > T(siteID 12)**  (my general impression)
Note that if I had plotted any other site on that same graph, the differences would have been much more pronounced.


If you look at the ASHRAE sites in Europe, you have 3 in UK+Ireland: London, Loughborough, Dublin.
Other Europe sites (Madrid,Lisbon,Athens, Romania) sound like they would have a very different temperature profile.
Could site 12 be Dublin because it is colder? And maybe site 5 Loughborough, site 1 =  London (London is more south)?
Let's see if the pattern of holidays work with our theory.
Some holidays in Ireland (2016):
Mar 25-28
May 2
June 6
Aug 1
Oct 31
Some holidays in the UK (2016):
Mar 25-28
May 2
May 30
Aug 29
I bolded the ones that are different 
I filtered meter reading time series data to have only week days and education buildings. 
Let's look at the troughs on the following 3 plots.
Site 1 (London?) has:
May 2
May 30
Aug 29

Site 5 (Loughborough?) 
Mar 25-28
May 2
May 19 (???)
May 30
July 7 (???)
Aug 29

Site 12 (Dublin?) has:
March 25-28
May 3rd
June 6  (and not May 30 - UK)
(not Aug 1 - Ireland)
(not Aug 29 - UK)
October 31
But also a bunch of other troughs!

It's not quite perfect, but it looks like Site 12 has the Ireland-only holidays while sites 1 and 5 have the UK only holidays.
An unrelated but important observation is that buildings in site 12 seem to turn off their systems on a monthly basis often around the 6th of the month. Could this be some sort of regular maintenance?",Site Locations

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) both are the techniques to find out the difference between the values predicted by your machine learning model and the actual values.
To understand these concepts and their differences, it is important to know what does Mean Squared Error (MSE) mean. MSE incorporates both the variance and the bias of the predictor. RMSE is the square root of MSE. In case of unbiased estimator, RMSE is just the square root of variance, which is actually Standard Deviation.
In case of RMSLE, you take the log of the predictions and actual values. So basically, what changes is the variance that you are measuring. I believe RMSLE is usually used when you don't want to penalize huge differences in the predicted and the actual values when both predicted and true values are huge numbers.

If both predicted and actual values are small: RMSE and RMSLE is same.
If either predicted or the actual value is big: RMSE > RMSLE
If both predicted and actual values are big: RMSE > RMSLE (RMSLE becomes almost negligible)

The Robustness of RMSLE to the outliers, the property of calculating the relative error between the Predicted and Actual Values, the most unique property of the RMLSE that it penalizes the underestimation of the actual value more severely than it does for the Overestimation.

No dropping of data
No creation of statistical aggregate features
No creation of lag features
No aligning of timestamp

The only special treatment seems to be dividing the data into two halves by time, and building two models and averaging predictions. Just this gives a very competitive score.

The best score boost in this competition was achieved thanks to data cleaning. There are plenty of training examples that might be removed. For example building_id's from 0 to 104 have all 0's (or almost 0's) for the period starting from January 1st 2016 until May 20th 2016. So all of this samples should be removed from the training set.

Some buildings have suspicious 0 readings somewhere in the middle, like building_id 1066

Code to remove data:
""not (building_id == 1066 &amp; meter == 0 &amp; timestamp >= ""2016-02-13 20:00:00"" &amp; timestamp <= ""2016-02-29 11:00:00"")""
And another example - building_id 1250 & meter 2. It has all 0's until the middle of December. So my guess was that this type of meter was not functioning, but started at December. Based on that guess the small amount of non-zero data is very useful, especially because the readings are so high (around 8000).

Code to remove data:
""not (building_id == 1250 &amp; meter == 2 &amp; timestamp < ""2016-12-21 16:00:00"")""
I have been using my plots from this post to visually understand which readings might be removed.
Overall our file with data cleaning queries contains 102 lanes. That is including both training set and leaked set. Yes, we did cleaned leaked data and used it as a training examples.
CV strategy
2 Folds strategy from Half and half showed a really good performance. But since it splits all data simply in the middle it has disadvantages because some of the buildings have samples only starting from June, July or even November. So they will be only presented in one fold.
So I have created a slightly different strategy - using half and half, but now for the whole training set, but for every meter of every building in it. In other words - if building have readings only for 6 months, starting from July, then 1st fold will contain all the readings from July till September and 2nd fold will contain readings from September till December.
Below is a picture with an example. Pay attention that data for building_id 555 starts only from July.

And here is the code to create two folds for the whole dataset, splitting each meter of each buildings somewhere in the middle:
fold1 = []
fold2 = []
folds = [fold1, fold2]

# Iterating over each building
for building in tqdm_notebook(range(1449)):
    # And over each possible meter type for each building
    for meter in range(4):
        sub_df = train[(train['building_id']==building) &amp; (train['meter']==meter)]
        # Dividing by two, because we will train on 2 folds
        samples = int(sub_df.shape[0] / 2)
        # If there are any samples for the specific meter type of the specific building...
        if samples:
            # Filling indexes for both folds. 
            # They will be splitted by time, since at this moment train is sorted by time.
            fold1 += list(sub_df.index[:samples])
            fold2 += list(sub_df.index[samples:])

This CV strategy performs better and OOF score better aligns with LB.
Feature engineering
We have used around 50 features in our model. Some of the features are well known from public kernels, such as lags. But some of them were mined using CV strategy.
One of the features is a temperature difference between two readings for each building_id. It improved a score a bit.
Code example:
train['air_temperature_diff1'] = train['air_temperature'] - train.groupby(['building_id', 'meter'])['air_temperature'].shift(1)
Also we have used holidays as a features, SIN\COS transformations and so on.
Model
We mostly used LightGBM as it showed best performance. I believe we used only one CatBoost model for the blending. Neural Network didn't show a good performance.
Final submission is a blend of around 10 models (or some number around that).
Leaked data
Yes, we used leaked data both for training and in the submission file to replace our predictions with ground truth labels.",Solution

Last year I uploaded a public dataset with energy consumption (at the power utility level) and created a few kernels about predicting time series data. This data may be most similar to the 'electricity' meter types in the ASHRAE dataset. Hopefully some find it helpful:

https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption
https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/tutorial-time-series-forecasting-with-prophet
https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/tutorial-time-series-forecasting-with-xgboost

One thing that will become very apparent as you look at the data is how energy consumption is strongly correlated with the time of year, day of week, and hour within the day. At least for electricty this is because much of the power feeds air conditioning units - which are used more in the summer months, and can be shut off during weekends and at nights.
If we look at the median meter_reading value by meter type through the year of data we are given you can see a clear curve:

It's also interesting to see that we are provided with only 1 year of data, and expected to predict 2 years. This means we must select models and validation schemes that can account for these annual trends, without having more than one year to work with.

One thing I'm not a fan of is that the weather data is provided. It's clear that weather is strongly correlated with energy consumption, but we can't predict exactly what the future weather will be- so why would we incorporate it into our models if we are trying to predict the future? I've had a few arguments with consultants about this exact fact- weather data is only valuable if you believe the weather forecast is strong enough to improve your model. This means you need to train your models on the forecast not the actualized weather data. At least in real life that's the way it works 😄 .
I'm excited about this competition though, it looks like it will be a lot of fun. I'll be updating my EDA kernel with more insights as I continue to dig through the data.

Some thoughts about Energy Consumption and Similar Data by @robikscube (kaggler and electrical engineer).


Important conclusion by @dmitriyguller 

If meter_reading= 0.0 means that a reading wasn't taken, and then the next positive reading ""catches up"" on the incremental changes since the last positive reading, then it's actually a problem with the RMSLE metric.
  With a mean-preserving metric, this bunching would just create noise, but on average you would still get the right incremental value; if you were supposed to have readings of ""100"" and ""200"" for the two hours, but you get ""0"" and ""300"" instead, either way you get 150 on average. However, (log(101) + log(201)) / 2 amounts to a different number than (log(1) + log(301)) / 2; it's 4.96 vs 2.85, in this example. The implication is that your prediction of the building's energy use should take into account the likelihood of the meter not updating every hour, implicitly or explicitly.
  Is the prediction for the building low because it's energy efficient, or because its meters get stuck more often? The organizers won't know, so there will be a big question mark over any conclusion that they reach from the models trained to optimize the RMSLE metric. This is the kind of nonsense that happens when you use a kludge metric, and don't think through what side effects you're introducing by using it.

Something should be going on and we are completely unaware of it. Yet, we checked the discussion board and the notebooks for any hint, but we found nothing, zero. Sincerely we suspect someone did private sharing of ideas, code or submissions, I do not fear of hinting openly at that. 
This has been a misfortunated competition, but as a team we held on until the end and working hard up so far because we were sincerely interested in the topic. But now the competition is ending in an even worse way than we expected.

Your task is to estimate the energy consumption of buildings over time. There are multiple viable routes for tackling this problem including time series, hierarchical, and standard regression techniques. You'll also need to to handle missing and noisy data. Accurate models of building energy use have many possible applications, so we're excited to see what you can come up with.
If you need a change of pace consider taking a look at our replica of the original competition from 1993. That was back when support vector machines were cutting edge!

Another powerful one that can handle multivariate data is StumPy. It is able to handle multivariate data but I have not used it with other auxiliary data like number of floors before. 
Both of these are probably worth exploring but it's very likely that the most successful approach will be like other time series competitions where people have had great success by featurizing the dataset and then utilizing their model of choice rather than using something time-series specific. They do this by flattening the dataset. Rather than looking at one row at a time while training they have done time lags and expanded the dataframe to include several of the timesteps before. So in a given row it might capture all of the information like site_id, current temperature, but also the temp an hour ago, and the temp 24 hours ago and so on.

Please find my findings so far:

Downsampling method
The training set is large (around 20 million). However, you really don't need to use all the data to train the models. I down sampled the training set from 20 million to 1 million and found that the models fitted in 1 million data always performed within 0.01 gap in LB, compared to their counterparts fitted in the whole data.

The downsampling method is slightly modified from sampling without replacement. I upload a file containing the sample_index. If you want to use it, please use the np.load method to load the file as an array.

Validation method
Unshuffle KFold with K = 2. When I improved my LB from 1.13 to 1.10 by adding engineering features, improvements in local CV always led to improvements in LB. I believe it's a stable validation approch.
Some useful features:


'hour': self-explanatory
'weekday': self-explanatory
'dayinmonth': self-explanatory
'is_weekend': self-explanatory
'buildingidcountfull': count encoding of buildingid
'yearbuiltcountfull': count encoding of yearbuilt
'siteidcloudcoverage48mean': mean value of cloudcoverage in the past 48 hours for each site.


Data cleaning
As I used 2 Fold CV, one strange thing I found is that the model fitted in the first fold performs significantly worse than the model fitted in the second fold (first fold 1.12 in LB, second fold 1.24 in LB, total 1.10 in LB)…Seems the data may be not clean for the first 6 months of 2016.

Hopes the findings can help and wish everyone a piece of good luck!! sample_index.npy (7.63 MB)",EDA

Okay, so 3 of the known sites (2,4,15) appear to be reporting in native units, while UCF is reporting is kBTU.
The big issue is the fact that we don't know about the units each site's meter's are recorded at. This in my opinion is a problem. It's possible that UCF is the only site out of 16 sites that is reporting differently, however, I would rather have peace of mind knowing that the rest of the sites share the consistency seen above rather than guessing.
If the units were provided to us, we could create better models. If you're building 2380 models, one per building's meter, okay, no big deal. But if you're building a single model and the target variables are in different units, then it likely that you're underfitting (unknowingly). Why? because you'll be training your model in different units for the same meter type. This is not ideal.
To bring the point home, imagine if your dataset was stock prices and some companies were reported by the data source was reporting in market capital instead of price per share. You would have different measurements for your stocks. This is what this dataset looks like.",Data Quality

It appears that for those days a daily sum has been reported instead of the hourly values. For example, for this specific building it is clear that there is something wrong with some days in July (colours correspond to June, July, August, sorry for the patchy graphs!):

And if we summarize the daily sums, it is evident that what is given as hourly measurement is probable the daily sum:

Why this is done escapes me, but it certainly affects how we deal with these values.
Would we assume that they report it this way in the next years?

There is no such definition as a ""FAIR competition"". It's a competition and you have to use all your knowledge and instruments to have a result.
Examples? Sure.

It's tabular data competition but lgbm doesn't work -> it's unfair to use NN as I don't work with NN.
It's a CV competition but I don't have GPU on the local machine -> competition should be canceled.
It's NLP competition but I didn't do data augmentation because I'm lazy -> No translations should be permitted.
There is some ""magic"" in data but I didn't find it -> competition is badly prepared and should be canceled.
There is some strange metric in competition but I can't create my loss function as I'm bad it this -> Metric and labels are inappropriate and competition should be canceled.
I have no friends but it's hard to be on top solo - no team should be permitted.

Fair competition? Never. Life is unfair. Humble yourself. 
You want to win - use all you have. Models/Data/Maths/Team/Books.
Don't devalue all efforts of hundreds and thousands of kagglers wich are investing a lot of time in data analysis and modeling. Don't like - don't participate. But don't be toxic, please. You say it's a shitty competition and with these words, you are ruining hundreds of hours of someone's work because  someone stops believe in what he is doing.
You can learn something in any competition and even without competition at all. There is no such thing as a meaningless activity but you force people to quit. I can't support you in this, sorry.
Competition organizers are not dumb to permit win with scrapping. You don't know how the private part will be scored. Want risk and base your score on scrapping? I wouldn't do so. I would better have a stable model and a stable CV. Will I use scrapped data? Sure. It's just an instrument as any other.  Is it cheat? No. As all people are in the same position and all data is shared.

Why this post appeared?
In the last few days, I've seen that many people were talking that it's unfair to use scrapped data and competition is meaningless. I've seen also that many people are quitting (stormed off).

The issue seems to be more general, as it turns out that there are also such time series with different meter type.

There are also series where the issue occurs in the second half of the year or throughout the year.


I removed from the training dataset the sections where the issue occurs and tried a basic LightGBM algorithm.

Save your dataframe as pickle file for fast read.

Do not Forget to save your work. This way you can access the downcasted df everytime you load it!
The idea behind the this is based on the fact that most of the column only takes few values and pandas can limit those values only to the few categorical value to save the memory.
Often in real-time, data includes the text columns, which are repetitive. Features like gender, country, and codes are always repetitive. These are the examples for categorical data.
Categorical variables can take on only a limited, and usually fixed number of possible values. Besides the fixed length, categorical data might have an order but cannot perform numerical operation. Categorical are a Pandas data type.
The categorical data type is useful in the following cases −
A string variable consisting of only a few different values. Converting such a string variable to a categorical variable will save some memory.
The lexical order of a variable is not the same as the logical order (“one”, “two”, “three”). By converting to a categorical and specifying an order on the categories, sorting and min/max will use the logical order instead of the lexical order.
**As a signal to other python libraries that this column should be treated as a categorical variable (e.g. to use suitable statistical methods or plot types)."" (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_pandas/python_pandas_categorical_data)**

It is impossible to use statistics to decide whether the usage has just reached a new level and the December mean should applied for all of the future, or whether the early year lower level will work again for the next year, right?

Here at least January and December levels match, but it is impossible to know whether the May/June usage is an outlier and is going to repeat?

If so, then this is not fair for other participants.
Because none of us those know what data are actually leaked data. If we have a chance to re-pick the best submissions based on the new public LB, a lot of us would do so.  Because we have no idea what building meters are actually optimized when hyperparameters are tuned. If the final submission is not chosen before competition ends, the system will pick a submission which fits the actual test data better, this would be a huge benefit.
This is based on the assumption that the ""new"" public LB has no leaked data. But if the new public LB contains a higher percentage of leaked data then the previous one -
then it would be really bad for those who didn't pick their submission before the game ends. Because the system will pick the submission which is biased towards the leaked data.
Whichever the case is, it will be unfair. So there is no need for the host to re-score everything.

Test data has long term and many building data, so the ‘missing time values’ may be included. Or it may be occurred Blackout.

Pearson's r : Pearson's correlation coefficient is the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations. The form of the definition involves a ""product moment"", that is, the mean (the first moment about the origin) of the product of the mean-adjusted random variables; hence the modifier product-moment in the name. 

Spearman's rho : In statistics, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient or Spearman's rho, named after Charles Spearman and often denoted by the Greek letter ρ (rho) or as
r_{s}, is a nonparametric measure of rank correlation (statistical dependence between the rankings of two variables). It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function.
The Spearman correlation between two variables is equal to the Pearson correlation between the rank values of those two variables; while Pearson's correlation assesses linear relationships, Spearman's correlation assesses monotonic relationships (whether linear or not). If there are no repeated data values, a perfect Spearman correlation of +1 or −1 occurs when each of the variables is a perfect monotone function of the other.
Intuitively, the Spearman correlation between two variables will be high when observations have a similar (or identical for a correlation of 1) rank (i.e. relative position label of the observations within the variable: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) between the two variables, and low when observations have a dissimilar (or fully opposed for a correlation of −1) rank between the two variables.
Spearman's coefficient is appropriate for both continuous and discrete ordinal variables. Both Spearman's ρ and Kendall's τ can be formulated as special cases of a more general correlation coefficient.

Kendall's Tau : In statistics, the Kendall rank correlation coefficient, commonly referred to as Kendall's tau coefficient (after the Greek letter τ), is a statistic used to measure the ordinal association between two measured quantities. A tau test is a non-parametric hypothesis test for statistical dependence based on the tau coefficient.
It is a measure of rank correlation: the similarity of the orderings of the data when ranked by each of the quantities. It is named after Maurice Kendall, who developed it in 1938, though Gustav Fechner had proposed a similar measure in the context of time series in 1897.
Intuitively, the Kendall correlation between two variables will be high when observations have a similar (or identical for a correlation of 1) rank (i.e. relative position label of the observations within the variable: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) between the two variables, and low when observations have a dissimilar (or fully different for a correlation of −1) rank between the two variables. Both Kendall's τ and Spearman's ρ can be formulated as special cases of a more general correlation coefficient. 
PhiK is a new and practical correlation coefficient based on several refinements to Pearson's hypothesis test of independence of two variables. The combined features of PhiK form an advantage over existing coefficients. First, it works consistently between categorical, ordinal and interval variables. Second, it captures non-linear dependency. Third, it reverts to the Pearson correlation coefficient in case of a bi-variate normal input distribution. These are useful features when studying the correlation matrix of variables with mixed types.
The presented algorithms are easy to use and available through this public Python library: the correlation analyzer package. Emphasis is paid to the proper evaluation of statistical significance of correlations and to the interpretation of variable relationships in a contingency table, in particular in case of low statistics samples.
For example, the Phi_K correlation analyzer package has been used to study surveys, insurance claims, correlograms, etc.

People in this competition seem to be doing this well, but then when it comes to submitting, they use the exact same models they trained during cross validation to do the submitting. 
There's nothing wrong with this of course, and if it gets you higher on the LB then more power to you, but I think there's a big benefit to having a submission strategy separate to your CV strategy. 
For instance, a super common CV strategy is to train a model m on 80% of the data and then score m based on the remaining 20%.  You then use this score to try out different things. For instance you try adding different feature sets to your dataset and see which feature set trains the m that scores the highest.
Now that you've used this CV strategy to find a good feature set though, you wouldn't use m to make your submission. We know that models perform better if you feed them more data, so every time you want to submit you'd throw out m and train a new model M on 100% of the data and the best feature set you found though CV. You then submit M's predictions. 
Point is: you don't need to use your CV strategy to make submissions, and in fact, having a separate submission strategy gives you some nice freedoms. For instance often my CV strategy involves a very high LR and low number of iterations, or only uses a small fraction of the data to make it faster. If I made submissions with the same models though, I'd do really badly. ",Cross-validation

I might be wrong, but it makes sense to me that features that act as identifiers (id's or names, etc) can contribute a lot to overfitting. My way of thinking is that they could sort of ""map"" the target value to each building, or does the fact that each building can have more than 1 meter_reading prevent that?

By the way, it finished running and produced the result but had an error I do not understand.

I’m saying so because when I check « my submissions » and sort all submissions by score in descending order, the one I made just now is indeed at the top.

I'm quite new to machine learning and especially time series prediction, so i have a couple (maybe silly) questions regarding this:

If using ARIMA, are you supposed to do rolling forecasting? if so, it seems the amount of training needed is crazy given how many data points there are. Also how are you supposed to do rolling forecasting with test set? based on lightgbm's predictions?
How does ARIMA with external regressors work? and do these regressors have to be time series as well (temperature etc)? 
Is LSTM a good choice for this problem? has anyone tried that?
It was mentioned in another discussion that you can do fourier and ARIMA, how does that work?

There may be many reasons why there are gaps: 

The meter is off.
Communication error with meter.
The software that collects data (or part of it) is hung.
The server is off.

I did a notebook analysing the gaps in the train and test set. Where you can see the results:

In train set, there are 689,820 gaps for a total of 20,216,100 samples. The ratio of gaps is: 3.41%.
In test set, there is no gap at all.

It is very unlikely that there is no gap in the test set. I expected that there would be gaps in the test set, in which no prediction would have to be made.
I ask myself a few questions for which I have no answers:

Why there are no gaps?
What values will there be instead of the gaps?
How can it affect the score?

Data leakage (or leakage) happens when your training data contains information about the target, but similar data will not be available when the model is used for prediction. This leads to high performance on the training set (and possibly even the validation data), but the model will perform poorly in production.
In other words, leakage causes a model to look accurate until you start making decisions with the model, and then the model becomes very inaccurate.
There are two main types of leakage: target leakage and train-test contamination.

I have been working on the ASHRAE dataset and found (as many of you have done) many missing values.
Instead of dropping them, I have decided to fill the values (forward and backwards) based on the site_id and a time mask you generate.
You can see the full code here: https://www.kaggle.com/python10pm/ashrae-filling-missing-values-by-groups
If we look at the Weather DataFrame, we start with this situation:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The column airtemperature has 55 null values. It is 0.04% of total rows.
The column airtemperature is of type float64.
The column cloudcoverage has 69173 null values. It is 49.49% of total rows.
The column cloudcoverage is of type float64.
The column dewtemperature has 113 null values. It is 0.08% of total rows.
The column dewtemperature is of type float64.
The column precipdepth1hr has 50289 null values. It is 35.98% of total rows.
The column precipdepth1hr is of type float64.
The column sealevelpressure has 10618 null values. It is 7.6% of total rows.
The column sealevelpressure is of type float64.
The column winddirection has 6268 null values. It is 4.48% of total rows.
The column winddirection is of type float64.
The column windspeed has 304 null values. It is 0.22% of total rows.
The column windspeed is of type float64.
The DataFrame has 7 columns with null values. It is 63.64% of total columns.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I then generate the following timemasks and sort the values:
weatherdf[""YYYYMMDD""] = weatherdf[""timestamp""].apply(lambda strtime: datetime.datetime.strptime(strtime, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S').strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))
weatherdf[""YYYYMM""] = weatherdf[""timestamp""].apply(lambda strtime: datetime.datetime.strptime(strtime, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S').strftime('%Y-%m'))
weatherdf.sortvalues([""site_id"", ""timestamp""], ascending = True, inplace = True)
Afterwards I start to fill the values with the following code, where columns are all the columns that contain nulls:
grouperlist = [""siteid"", ""YYYYMMDD""]
weatherdf[columns] = weatherdf.groupby(grouper_list)[columns].transform(lambda x: x.ffill().bfill())
We get the following result:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The column cloudcoverage has 25395 null values. It is 18.17% of total rows.
The column cloudcoverage is of type float64.
The column precipdepth1hr has 40567 null values. It is 29.02% of total rows.
The column precipdepth1hr is of type float64.
The column sealevelpressure has 8892 null values. It is 6.36% of total rows.
The column sealevelpressure is of type float64.
The DataFrame has 3 columns with null values. It is 27.27% of total columns.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we iterate one more time with this code:
grouperlist = [""siteid"", ""YYYYMM""]
weatherdf[columns] = weatherdf.groupby(grouper_list)[columns].transform(lambda x: x.ffill().bfill())
We will get:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The column cloudcoverage has 17228 null values. It is 12.33% of total rows.
The column cloudcoverage is of type float64.
The column precipdepth1hr has 26273 null values. It is 18.8% of total rows.
The column precipdepth1hr is of type float64.
The column sealevelpressure has 8755 null values. It is 6.26% of total rows.
The column sealevelpressure is of type float64.
The DataFrame has 3 columns with null values. It is 27.27% of total columns.
The column cloudcoverage has 17228 null values. It is 12.33% of total rows.
The column cloudcoverage is of type float64.
The column precipdepth1hr has 26273 null values. It is 18.8% of total rows.
The column precipdepth1hr is of type float64.
The column sealevelpressure has 8755 null values. It is 6.26% of total rows.
The column sealevelpressure is of type float64.
The DataFrame has 3 columns with null values. It is 27.27% of total columns.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After this, even if we fill the values by the mean of site_id, we still have the same numbers of nulls, so maybe dropping them makes sense.
Please share your thoughts on this and what have you've done for this particular dataset.

If you see something similar do not panic because it may not have rescored you/ your team's best submission or the chosen one yet hence you are not place right. For example my LB=1.431 is a submission from 2 months ago and definately not my best. So my advise is to calm down, stay positive and hope for the best :-)
If you scroll down all the way to 3677, you will see all the rescored teams so far as you go down from there.

It is clear from the leaked data that many of the sites are universities with district energy systems, i.e. centralized plants that deliver energy products (chilled water, steam, etc.) to the campus buildings.  In those cases, there is no production/generating equipment in the buildings, and the energy consumption is metered at the building entrance.  Stand-alone buildings contain internal production/generating equipment.  So why does that matter?  
For district energy supplied buildings, the various products are fairly independent, although there are interactions if heating and cooling are supplied simultaneously.  For stand-alone buildings, unless the meter readings are properly prepared, they will double count consumption.  For example, a building chiller that produces chilled water will use electricity that will be recorded at the electrical meter, but the energy output of the chilled water delivered will also be metered.  The relationship between the output of the chiller and its input is an efficiency measure e.g., KW/Ton, and must be subtracted from the electrical meter reading to give a true reading of building energy consumption.  Suppose further that the building is supplied by rooftop units which contain independent fans, refrigeration units, and heating, possibly electric, all in a single enclosure.  Now you're seeing everything as electric.  A similar building will have an entirely different energy profile.  Site information won't help you here.  You need an independent solution for each building.
This suggests to me that categorization of the building metadata needs to be improved to include such information, and that, probably, this entire competition is a waste of time for such a large amorphous set of buildings. ",Reference Material

Lag features are the classical way that time series forecasting problems are transformed into supervised learning problems. The simplest approach is to predict the value at the next time (t+1) given the value at the previous time (t-1).

I've had some success using leak validation for blending (Thanks to @yamsam for this useful kernel : https://www.kaggle.com/yamsam/ashrae-leak-validation-and-more ) but when I tried using it for single model validation my model (LGBM) score suffered. I realize that the leak data is not fully representative because it is only a few sites, but my naive hope was that it might do better than time based CV splits where some of the information about seasonal patterns is hidden from each fold.
What I'm wondering is:
1) Is the mismatch between the leak validation score and lb score because it somehow stops training at a point where it has only learnt well for some sites/buildings but not others and will this differ based on what kind of model (Tree based, Neural Net, etc) is used?
2) Or is it that the time split CV approach did better only because that was multiple models and it was already harnessing the advantages of ensembling somehow?
Anyone here tried/had any success using the leaks as a validation set? Curious to hear what your thoughts and experience regarding this are :) ",Data Leak

This may have been discussed or I just couldn't find the answer for the meaning behind 0.0 meter reading in the training set. I also wonder in the score of the test set, do we expect 0.0 reading values too? 
For me they are 2 separate problems if 0.0 is expected in the prediction? Is it because of the failed sensors? or any other reasons?

the way we ask questions in the discussion forums and get replys i think it would be good if we are being notified on our mails or a better way.
when i get replied they are thousands of discussion i have to start checking if anybody replied me or not.And also notifications if there are new discussions in new competitions i join.",Other

Any suggestions, some notebooks start up code, or maybe how to proceed?
I am not concerned with the accuracy rather than the implementation, i tried a simple neural network for regression, however i get Nan in the loss function.
Any guidance, instructions or starter code (preferably ) is much appreciated. Thanks",Modelling Strategy
