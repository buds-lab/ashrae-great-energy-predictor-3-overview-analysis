"['With less than 24 hours to go, and still a lot of chatter on ""data leaks"" (we can get into the semantics of the terminology at a later date ðŸ˜‰ ) we noted that we\'ll ensure none of the leaked data will appear in the test set. \nTo prevent any massive, unexpected shakeups after the competition has closed, we will be performing a few final checks on the leaderboard and will reveal the private leaderboard when we finalize it (i.e. at the same time we have performed our anti-cheating removals). \nWe expect to finalize the leaderboard approximately 24-48 business hours after the competition has closed, per our usual timeline.\nThanks for your patience, we want to maintain the integrity of ""the grand reveal"" as best as possible. Feel free to post solutions and write-ups in the meantime.\nAddison']",
